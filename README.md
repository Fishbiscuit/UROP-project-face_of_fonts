This is a project submitted for the First National Collegiate and International Invitational Tournament on Brain-inspired Computing by Tsinghua University

Our team hypothesised that typography had semantic meaning, proceeding to gather our own dataset and applied machine learning algorithms to test our hypothesis. Our submission provided a prelimianry typeface recommendation by analysing a design brief.

# Methodology

# Classification Model
Without lots of training data, we need external semantic information. Therefore, instead of using the con-
ventional bag-of-words (BOW) model, we employ word-embedding models. We have chosen word2vec's
GoogleNews corpus which was formed with 3 billion running words resulting in 3 million 300-dimension
word vectors. To obtain a larger dataset we split each company description into individual sentences.
To tackle the problem of word relations, we use deeper neural networks. This is illustrated in Yoon Kim's
paper titled "Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification". It is a simple CNN with
one layer of convolution on top of word vectors.

# Our Recommendations
1. MUSEUM OF IMAGE AND SOUND
Studio: ps.2 arquitetura + design
Art direction: Fabio Prata, Flavia Nalon
Designers: Fabio Prata, Flavia Nalon, Aurelian Hallhuber, Lisa Moura, Lucas Blat
"The museum will offer a journey throughout the cultural history of Rio { a well-known and cele-
brated city for its Carnival, Samba and Bossa Nova. Besides being a cultural center, the museum
will also function as a hub to produce and promote culture. Its 9.8 thousand square meters will oer
the public an innovative exhibit design in order to digitally display the institution's collection that
includes different documents, photographs, billboards, records, footage, videos, newspapers clippings,
and texts. MIS will also house and display the Carmem Miranda Museum collection.
The museum's program includes short and long term exhibitions, research offices, educational ac-
tivities room, a 280-seat theater/cinema, a shop, a cafeteria, a panoramic restaurant, a bar/rooftop
terrace, a nightclub and an observation deck, as well as a kiosk on the beachfront."

\A good design is starting with an excellent idea. Leading to a bucket of added spontaneity. Free
flow gestures in the making. This attracts us a lot. Unexpected, playful results: it becomes beautiful
and useful. When it comes to furniture, we believe that good design should be free and sharp. As
an eagle above the forest."

# Limitations
As corporations have multiple beachheads when running their operations, there is substantial difficulty
in getting a dataset that is relevant. Sometimes not all information is contained within the company's
webpage. Therefore, we had to continuously tweak our dataset to be able to generate a representative
model of the semantic in typography. The logical link that designers create a corporate identity according
to a company's brand will mean that we need to find out a succinct and accurate description of a company.
There are also limitations in the dataset due the randomness in choosing the companies; no specific
economic sector was targeted. Moreover, the typefaces chosen might not entirely focus on the motivations
in the meaning the company might try to convey, but rather limited by the accessibility of fonts and
considerations on readability.
